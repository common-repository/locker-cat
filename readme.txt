Social Locker & Content Locker - Locker Cat Lets You Add A Content Lock To Your Site. You'll Get More Shares & Traffic. Guaranteed.

== Description ==

= Get More Viral Traffic With “Social Locker & Content Locker - Locker Cat” =
Do you want to get more viral traffic and social shares? Look no further than Locker Cat.

Our social locker lets you hide content (text, videos, images, download links) from your visitors, until they share it on social media.

This __works insanely well__. Even though you work your butt off to craft quality content, you probably only get a handful of shares on your posts. It boils down to incentives - generally your readers have no reason to share your content.

This plugin - Social Locker & Content Locker - Locker Cat - solves this problem. Simply wrap your content inside of our `[lockercat]` shortcode, and your visitors will be required to share it in order to unlock it.

Here's an example:

`[lockercat]My locked content[/lockercat]`

You can add this shortcode __anywhere__ on your WordPress site, including your Posts and Pages.

Social lockers are a highly effective way to maximize your social shares and __get more viral traffic__.

Here are some ideas on how you can use a social locker to get more shares:

* Give away bonus content, such as videos, images or whitepapers.
* Partially hide blog posts from your readers
